# Contributing

Hi there! Interested in contributing to `react-telegram-web-app`? We'd love your help

## Goals

The main goal of the project is to make it convenient to use Telegram Mini Apps in react applications

## Ways to contribute

- [Install package](./README.md#-installation--get-started) and kick the tires. Does it work? Does it do what you'd expect? If not, [open an issue](https://github.com/vkruglikov/react-telegram-web-app/issues) and let us know.
- Comment on some of the project's [open issues](https://github.com/vkruglikov/react-telegram-web-app/issues). Have you experienced the same problem? Know a workaround? Do you have a suggestion for how the feature could be better?
- Browse through the [discussions](https://github.com/vkruglikov/react-telegram-web-app/discussions), and lend a hand answering questions. There's a good chance you've already experienced what another user is experiencing.

## Submitting a pull request

### Before you create pull request

- Make sure your changes meet the project's goals
- Before you do something, make sure that other members of the community really need it
- Do not change the basic logic of Telegram Mini Apps, even if there are errors in it. Instead you need to open an issue at https://bugs.telegram.org/

### Pull requests generally

- The smaller the proposed change, the better. If you'd like to propose two unrelated changes, submit two pull requests.
- The more information, the better. Make judicious use of the pull request body. Describe what changes were made, why you made them, and what impact they will have for users.
- If this is your first pull request, it may help to [understand GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).

## Proposing updates to the documentation

Documentation is generated using [typedoc](https://typedoc.org/guides/overview/).
Look at the examples and describe the documentation sufficiently fully

## Respect the work of other developers

- Don't change the basic styling settings without a good reason
- Do not change basic project settings such as title and personal links
